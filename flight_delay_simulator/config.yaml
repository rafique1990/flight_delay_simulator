# Simulation configuration

# This config tell you : if you  want to :
# run a fixed simulation called deterministic (fixed values) or
#   monte_carlo (random sampling) - runs n simulations by generating the departure delay(d) ,extra time in air(i) and maximum time ground time (e.g. loading/unloading)
mode: monte_carlo

# Number of Monte Carlo runs (ignored in deterministic mode)
n_runs: 3

# Delay distributions (Normal only)
departure_delay:
  mean: 10
  std: 3
inflight_delay:
  mean: 5
  std: 2
# Minimum turnaround time between flights (in minutes)
min_turnaround: 45
